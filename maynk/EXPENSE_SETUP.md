- `ManageExpensis.jsx` - Expense management dashboard
- `EditExpense.jsx` - Edit existing expense

### 2. Features

### 3. Navigation

## Installation Steps

### 1. Backend Dependencies
The backend already has all required dependencies. The expense routes are automatically loaded.

### 2. Frontend Dependencies
```bash
cd client
npm install react-hot-toast
```

### 3. Database
The expense collection will be created automatically when the first expense is added.

## Usage Instructions

### Adding an Expense
1. Navigate to "Add Expense" in the admin sidebar
2. Select a category from the dropdown
3. If "Other" is selected, a new field will appear for custom category
4. Fill in all required fields (marked with *)
5. Submit the form

### Managing Expenses
1. Navigate to "Manage Expenses" in the admin sidebar
2. Use filters to find specific expenses
3. View analytics by clicking the "Analytics" button
4. Approve/reject pending expenses
5. Edit or delete expenses (only if status is "Pending")

### Analytics
- Total expenses and amounts
- Breakdown by category
- Status distribution
- Recent expenses list
- Monthly trends

## API Integration

### Authentication
All API calls require a Bearer token in the Authorization header:
```
Authorization: Bearer <your-jwt-token>
```

### Example API Usage
```javascript
// Create expense
const response = await fetch('/api/v1/expense/create', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    category: 'Office Rent',
    amount: 50000,
    description: 'Monthly office rent payment',
    date: '2024-01-15',
    paymentMethod: 'Bank Transfer',
    vendor: 'ABC Properties',
    remarks: 'January 2024 rent'
  })
});
```

## Customization

### Adding New Categories
To add new expense categories, modify the enum in:
1. `backend/models/Expense.js` - Add to category enum
2. `backend/controller/expenseController.js` - Add to getExpenseCategories function

### Styling
The components use Tailwind CSS classes and can be easily customized by modifying the className attributes.

### Validation
Form validation is handled both on frontend and backend. Custom validation rules can be added in the respective components.

## Security Features
- JWT token authentication
- Input validation and sanitization
- Role-based access control
- SQL injection prevention (MongoDB)
- XSS protection

## Performance Optimizations
- Database indexing on frequently queried fields
- Pagination for large datasets
- Efficient aggregation queries for analytics
- Lazy loading of components
- Optimized re-renders with React hooks

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **"Cannot find module 'authMiddleware'"** - Ensure the middleware file exists
2. **"react-hot-toast not found"** - Run `npm install react-hot-toast`
3. **API 401 errors** - Check JWT token in Authorization header
4. **Form validation errors** - Ensure all required fields are filled

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging by setting `NODE_ENV=development` in your environment variables.
